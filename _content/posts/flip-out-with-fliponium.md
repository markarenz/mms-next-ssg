metaDescription: Not to bury the lede, my new game Fliponium is now available for iPad and iPhone. The finished app took about 4 weeks to code from start to finish.

U2 was wrong. Things do change on New Years Day. To be specific, I was bored on the first of January and began work on an html5 tile-based game. In an afternoon, I had a playable demo. It passed the "fun test" so I spent another week on it before the limitations of non-Flash browser games drove me to port the whole thing to iOS.

The finished app took about 4 weeks to code from start to finish. This includes a couple of days to re-work the interface after my teenage daughter noted that the box in which the tiles slide was too light, something she referred to as a "design crime." The board is now much darker, which I can only assume means that I won't be tried in the Hague any time soon.

I really wanted to do something slightly new in the grid-and-tile genre, so in this version you don't touch the tiles. You rotate the whole board and use gravity to slide them into place. Slide them onto the target of corresponding color and blammo, you've cleared the board. The next level starts and you're hooked. Hooked! Bwahaha! It's fairly simple, designed to amuse you for five or ten minute increments as you wait for a flight or whatever. Enjoy!
