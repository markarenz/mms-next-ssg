Crab Hill Press are at it again- with a new holiday app more than a year in the making. Don't Open Before Christmas is a kid's book for iPad written by Bill Doyle and illustrated by all around amazing fellow Troy Cummings.

It just appeared in the app store and already we're getting some nice reviews. It's so great to work on a team of energetic, creative folks including producer Rachel Ericson. I'm ver proud of this one- loads of crazy interactive widgets and Easter eggs throughout.
