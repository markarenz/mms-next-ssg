I'll say up front that I have no business writing novels. Back in 2003, I was apparently unaware of this and went ahead and wrote one, anyway. Actually, it was my second. I made a terrible half-hearted attempt to find a publisher and then put it away for a while. Now that a decade has passed and the radiation levels have subsided somewhat, it seems like it might be finally safe to revisit.

So, what's the book about? It's about ninety nine cents. OK, here's the teaser:

> Town Name is the sort of place few people seem to think about very much. It never even got a proper moniker. Now this tiny Illinois town is on the brink of being swallowed up by the world's largest discount retail outlet, and resident activist Cecilia Beaumont is mounting a campaign to put a stop to the buyout. Unfortunately, the other residents are so thrilled to have an opportunity to finally move out that they just don't care. As Cecilia assists the mayor in shutting down the city, she races to uncover the city's long-buried secrets before the whole place is covered in lined pavement. Attempts remove the century-old Town Name curse fail, and her nascent relationship with a young retail executive only serves to confuse matters. As the days and hours wind down, it seems that all hope is lost. Or is it?

So, that's it. You can now get Town Name for the [Kindle](http://t.co/lYEua2yrSw). Just 99 cents. You can snag that Blue Oyster Cult deep cut on iTunes or you can download this book. The choice is yours, I guess. Also, I am terrible at self-promotion.
