I grew up the son of a commercial artist, so I understand when people say that what we do is a "lumpy" business. By this, they mean that work comes along all at once or not at all. In the last few years, I guess you could say that it would be more accurate to describe development as a "chunky" business.

I've brought the old games back and started work on a redesign to focus entirely on development projects. The process is going to take some time, though, since I'm doing this between the various "chunks" of paid work.
