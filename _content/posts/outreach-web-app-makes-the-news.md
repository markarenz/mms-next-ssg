I'm very proud to have had a chance to help an organization like Outreach Indiana. A few months ago, we put together a web app for them as an "audio tour" of the city (Indianapolis) through the eyes of a homeless teenager. Greg McGuirk produced the soundtrack.

Local news outlet [Fox59](http://fox59.com/2014/11/18/new-app-shares-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-homeless-teen/) ran a very nice story about it recently, bringing some much-deserved attention to the work Outreach does every single day.

[Here's a link to the web app itself.](http://www.outreachindiana.org/app)

Hint, hint: now is a great time to [click here](http://www.outreachindiana.org) and learn more about what they do and why they do it. Don't be shy: [click here](http://www.outreachindiana.org).

PS - This was a great example of when to do a native app vs. going with a multi-platform web app approach.
