It was the dumbest idea I ever had, clearly a bone-headed concept from top to bottom. I had to build it.

It's a social network built entirely around colors. You post colors, message other users with color, and even search in terms of colors. Users can upload photos (or take photos on their phones in the mobile version) and Swatchity reduces it to a color. The result is a social platform that is fully functional and yet utterly useless. My goal: to build the Goat Simulator of social networks.

_Why? Curiosity, I suppose._

When I was a kid in the 70's, a desire to know how things worked usually resulted in taking apart a clock radio. I lacked the tools and electrical/mechanical know-how to make one myself. In the digital world, however, it's much more feasible to mockup something and poke around inside.

In this case, I was curious about the inner-workings of social platforms and how might it be possible to build one on a very lightweight architecture. What better way to find out than to build one myself, albeit a very odd and not terribly useful one.

So, no. It's not meant to be a thing that people actually use (though reactions to it have been hilarious). It's mainly an exercise in structure, design, and how to use software as a delivery medium for telling a story. It beats the heck out of trying to get my clock radio back together.
