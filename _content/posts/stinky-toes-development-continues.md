When my son was very young, he used to ask for a story or two before bed. The trouble was that he grew bored with fairy tales fairly quickly. Maybe it was me who got bored. I honestly don't recall. Regardless, it didn't take long before I'd exhausted the entire canon of kid lore. So, I started making them up. He seemed to like the weird ones best, stories with an element of the absurd.

From that time one story seemed to stick with him more than the others: Stinky Toes The Pirate, the story of a young seafaring adventurer who yearns to take to the sea but his feet are so very smelly that no one will go sailing with him.

[Warning: the entire story is built around a horrific pun]

At some point, I threw together some illustrations and mocked up a book-like object for him. He memorized it and even now years later can still quote passages off the top of his head.

I've made several interactive kids books for other people, so at some point last summer it occurred to me that I really ought to re-work those drawings and see if I can make something fun out of it all.

Six months later, the page layouts are finally done, but it'll still be late 2015 before I'd even consider submitting it to Apple. The final product should be fun, though: rock skipping, sea monsters, digging for treasure, and very, very stinky feet.

Maybe I'll have a few hours in the next six months to click on it a bit more.
