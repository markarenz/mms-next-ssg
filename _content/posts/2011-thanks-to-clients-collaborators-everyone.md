2011 has been an incredible year in the stuff-making business. I've had opportunities to work on all kinds of interesting projects this year, and for that I am very thankful.

This includes...

- A new iPad book with Crab Hill Press
- A hybrid game for both mobile devices & desktop browsers
- 2 author sites for Random House
- A newsletter generating site for a technology consulting company
- A website for comedian Kathleen Madigan
- And several smaller brochure sites

And as the year ends, quite a few major projects are just finishing up. That includes a large-ish hospital website and a very exciting scavenger hunt website & app. Maybe in this coming year I'll manage to make good on my promise from this time last year: to add to the library of silly games that exist for no reason other than to amuse me. Time will tell.

No two projects are the same. No two clients are the same. And I feel deeply privileged to have worked with every single one of you. Cheers, everyone, and here's to a great 2012.
