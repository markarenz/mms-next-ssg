For the last few weeks, I've been writing bits for Erik Hermansen's Machine Court podcast (technology, science and other fun stuff).

It works like this: Erik will email with a topic or request and then I'll smack myself in the head with a ball peen hammer repeatedly until an idea comes or I lose consciousness, whichever comes first. It's a little like that level in Tony Hawk III when the digital skater kids call out tricks and you hurriedly hit the triangle button to accomplish a rail slide that you could never, ever pull off in real life. So far, it's been more fun than anyone my age should be allowed to have.

Bottom line is that this means I get to go around telling people that "I write for a show" even though it's not quite true. But that's OK. My life is a lie, anyway. This week's minisode is up: two sketches including a fun bit about Tycho Brahe.
