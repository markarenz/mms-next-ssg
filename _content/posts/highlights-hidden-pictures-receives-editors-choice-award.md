Break out the noisemakers! Drop the balloons! Highlights Hidden Pictures Puzzles has received the Editor's Choice award from the Children's Technology Review. Many thanks to designer Heather Smith and producer Chris Rettstatt. I'm immensely proud to have worked on this and wish the best for everyone involved.

The project was "bananas." Literally. There is a banana in nearly every puzzle and a special achievement if you happen to find them all.

By the way for those keeping score, this ranks up there with Crab Hill Press' Nash Smasher for "nicest things said about a project." Nash received a similar honor a few years ago. If I were in any way athletically gifted I would imagine those two projects spiking a football in celebration- but given my ignorance of such things, all I can picture is a rhesus monkey in a Ben Folds Five T-shirt riding a tricycle- which isn't quite right.
