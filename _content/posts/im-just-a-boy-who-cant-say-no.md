I'm finally getting around to updating the projects listing for 2012 after what has turned out to be the most hectic, challenging, thrilling, and terrifying year I can remember. 2012 has seen a pair of HTML5 games, several iPhone/iPad apps, a slew of websites, and even a phoneGap app for Android- and we're not quite done yet. A half dozen more are in the pipeline or in development.

Looking in the mirror, I could swear that I started the year with far more hair than I currently possess. That patch of skin atop my head could be due to the pressure or just a side effect of being over 40. I can't say for sure- though I suspect that it's a bit of both.
