Nash Smasher is a kids' pop-up book for the iPhone & iPad. Well, technically it's not possible for items to actually pop out of the device itself, but we were able to utilize many of the tried and true elements of the format to create something that felt both new and nostalgic at the same time - tabs, wheels, mix-and-match pictures, and rampant silliness. It's a story of a young man who enjoys smashing things and the trouble this causes him at a friend's birthday party. We also built Dutch & Chinese versions for the iPhone to help capture sales in those markets.
