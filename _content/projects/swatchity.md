I have a soft spot for silly ideas, projects that, while fully functional in every way, are essentially pointless. Back in 2014, I pitched the idea of a social media site where you can only post colors. My kids said they thought it was the dumbest thing they had every heard and that I must make it a reality, so I did.

In 2023, I was itching for a new project idea and reached back to an old one, remaking Swatchity with NextJS and Typescript. All the old features are there along with some new ones. You can post colors, search for colors. You can reply to posted colors with other colors. You can message other users with colors. Again, it was a very silly idea.
