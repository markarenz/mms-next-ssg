I grew up playing text adventure games in BASIC on an old TRS-80. The one that had the biggest impression on me was Pirate Adventure by Scott and Alexis Adams (not the Dilbert Scott Adams, a different one). I later learned that it was one of the first to ever implement an actual game "engine," a core of code that could be reused for several games with new game data (text, items, rules) for each release. I've always been a tad obsessive about quietly innovative stuff like this, so as a true Adams fan boy, I made my own interpreter for the original games a few years ago. More recently, I made an updated text adventure game engine in React.

Since several other interpreters for the original games exist (and I can't include their content in my repo for obvious copyright reasons), I decided to expand the reverse-engineered game engine to include updated creature comforts such as JSON for data format, local storage for game saves, and even game development tools for making new content. With that in mind, I made 2 new games for the release as well as a demo. The game dev process was so much fun that I may revisit this project in the future to make more games.

There is a brief [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8_UnTnrn_g) video about the project you might enjoy as well.
