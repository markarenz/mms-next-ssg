This promotional game for the Scorch Trials series of books presented a unique opportunity for a hybrid development approach: both Flash and HTML5/Javascript. On desktop computers the game plays in Flash. On mobile devices it plays in HTML5. The differences in game-play are minor and both versions use the same set of level maps. More than just a basic top-scrolling monster-basher, Survive The Scorch introduces an interesting twist: the heat. Players must seek the shade to keep from over-heating as they run through 10 levels of mazes.
