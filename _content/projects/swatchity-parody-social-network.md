It was the dumbest idea I ever had, clearly a bone-headed concept from top to bottom. I had to build it. It's a social network built entirely around colors. You post colors, message other users with color, and even search in terms of colors. Users can upload photos (or take photos on their phones in the mobile version) and Swatchity reduces it to a color. The result is a social platform that is fully functional and yet utterly useless. My goal: to build the Goat Simulator of social networks. "Why?" you ask? It was raining on a Sunday afternoon and I didn't want to clean the garage. It's as simple as that. 

Update: I took the original Swatchity offline a few years ago. That version was built using older technology, and after a few years I didn't want to press my luck on security issues. As of 2023, I am working on an updated version using modern tools and frameworks. More news on that soon (hopefully). The original Swatchity does still run on my laptop, however, so if you'd like to see what Swatchity (v1) looks like in action, there is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE_icLnaeRs) that describes the project and includes captured footage of the application's UI.
