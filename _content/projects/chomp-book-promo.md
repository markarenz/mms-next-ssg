In this business, it's always a lot of fun to do work for someone you admire. This was certainly the case when we got the call from Random House / Knopf to put together a pair of promotional teaser trailers for Carl Hiaasen's new book Chomp. I've been a fan of his for years: Tourist Season, Sick Puppy, Native Tongue. The books are fantastic. Chomp fits in with his series of young-adult books: Hoot, Scat & Flush. Troy Cummings interpreted the cover art to create vibrant illustration and I made stuff move around on the screen.
