This website for natural stone and quartz provider Stoneworks is more than just a pretty face. With five locations in four states, the company needed a location manager that allows the company to offer location-specific content to users in that area. The location manager is fully integrated in the site- special offers, Google directions, social links as well as dynamic number insertion (DNI) for call tracking. The system pulls the location from SEM links or from a pre-existing cookie. The site can also detect the location for first time visitors.
