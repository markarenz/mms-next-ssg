What started as a side project to test what could be done with NextJS SSG (static site generation) turned into a very fun parody of a corporate website.

with posts about their groundbreaking Pizza as a Service (PaaS) technology offering or what to do if you get lost in the office's many semi-abandoned floors and meet one of the many phantoms who roam the halls. Also, there is no need to continue to open trouble tickets with the maintenance team because we are aware that the 14th floor is flooded. We did it on purpose.

The fictional company FlubCo is a conglomerate buying up all kinds of businesses, which allowed me to wrap it into the backstory of of a other side project, Swatchity, with the notion that FlurbCo acquired Swatchity, twice.
