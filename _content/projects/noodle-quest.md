A perfect quarantine project, Noodle Quest started off as an exercise in using SVG animations in a React project and it became an isometric adventure game for kids. Sometimes, I find it interesting to do a project from the inside out - start with a mechanic or look that I like then work outward to a releasable product. The result is a very simple game that extends a bit of what most of us imagine React can do when it comes to game engines. I rebuilt the items and area map system several times, optimizing the state management to get the game to run smoother on various devices.
