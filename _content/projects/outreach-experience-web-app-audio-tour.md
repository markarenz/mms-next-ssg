So proud to have been a part of this one: a web app for Outreach Indiana built around an audio tour of Indianapolis from the point of view of a homeless teenager. The map-driven, cross-platform app walks you through the experience of daily life (education, transportation, healthcare, shelter) when you have no fixed address.
