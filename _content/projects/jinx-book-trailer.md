For this promotional trailer for Jinx, a new book series by Sage Blackwood published by HarperCollins, the client asked for something that conveyed mystery, wonder and just a hint of danger and trepidation. The end result turned out rather lovely, I think. Not bad for only having the layered PSD of the cover art for source material. Sound design by the magically-coiffured musical genius Greg McGuirk.
