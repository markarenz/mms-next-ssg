As the title implies, Hank's dad drives a roller coaster car. In fact, all of his relatives drive amazingly fun fairground attractions (everything from log flumes & teacups to rocket ships). We have lots of animation in this one to have fun with the way the vehicles move. The educational emphasis here is on onomatopoeia based on the silly sounds the different cars make. Kids can interact with the sound words themselves to trigger fun stuff.
