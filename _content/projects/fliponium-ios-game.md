A game for iPad and iPhone that turns the grid-and-tile genre on it's head- literally! Well, that's probably a misuse of the term, but get the idea. Instead of touching the tiles directly, you turn the board to cause them to slide around. Move them onto the corresponding targets to clear the board. Capture bonuses and letters in F-L-I-P for huge bonuses. There's no countdown clock so take your time and relax if you want or burn through the levels like a crazy person. It's up to you.
