metaDescription: A bevy of Scrollmagic animation effects, javascript tom-foolery and hours of research bring to life the story of Johannes Kepler and Tyco Brahe.

I love books about the history of Science. Sam Kean's The Disappearing Spoon and Richard Holmes' The Age of Wonder are particularly fantastic. Having grown up with [Carl Sagan's Cosmos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCvBop41TuY), I always loved the story of humble math teacher Johannes Kepler whose ideas about planetary motion were completely wrong, until the one moment when he managed to solve the problem with geometry a generation before the advent of physics. In tribute to him and his work with Tyco Brahe, a.k.a. the world's most "baller" astronomer, I put together this simple one pager filled with fancy javascript animation triggers. 

Using Greensock and Scrollmagic, I managed to make something I used as a demonstration piece for how scrolling interactivity can add richness to a piece without overpowering the underlying content.
