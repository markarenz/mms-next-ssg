This iPhone/iPad universal app is an iOS take on the classic hidden pictures puzzle genre Highlights made famous decades ago. When I was a kid in the 70's, I spent hours finding the screw driver hidden in the bark of a tree or the teacup disguised as a girl's sleeve. When they approached me in the spring of 2012, I could not say no. The client already had a version of the app, but they wanted a complete rebuild of the concept in order to create something far more flexible and extensible. The finished product features in-app purchases, a comprehensive system for handling hundreds of existing puzzles, parental controls and a system for displaying marketing and other banners based on the user's region- and all of this presented in a variety of languages.
