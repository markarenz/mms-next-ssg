As a kid, I used to love playing simple text-only trading sims, buying and selling wheat and whatnot. As an adult, I love making web games with Typescript and React. Spice Hustle is a way to bring those two ideas together.

You travel along the Spice Road buying and selling items for a profit as you go. Earn a little money and upgrade your carrying capacity or join a guild for special prices and items. Expand your map to trade in far flung cities and make a mint.
