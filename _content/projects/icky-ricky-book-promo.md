Icky Ricky is a book series by Michael Rex about the grossest kid on the face of the planet. When Random House approached me about this, I wasn't sure I would have time to squeeze it in. But then I saw the illustrations and knew I had to find a way to do this. The notes from the producer were hilarious, suitable for framing - stuff like "more farts" and "adjust booger texture."
