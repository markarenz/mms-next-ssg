Re:hash is a mock social network based on rearranging snippets from old poems and stories. The idea came to me as a means of creating a space without the abuses often seen on Facebook and Twitter. Of course, people can always find ways to be awful, so I'm not claiming trolling is impossible on Re:hash, it's just very, very difficult.

NodeJS in the backend using Mongo for the database layer. React on the frontend with loads of new-ish GraphQL hooks to query and mutate. Loads of fun to put together.
