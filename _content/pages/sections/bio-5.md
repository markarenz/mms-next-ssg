## On My Honor

I have been involved in Scouting in one way or another for most of my life. I earned my Eagle in 1984 and 35 years later my son earned his. I served as Scoutmaster of his Troop for several years and still pitch in as a ASM and life-to-eagle coordinator. Additionally, I served a term as District Commissioner for Fall Creek, two relatively uneventful years if you don't count the managerial tightrope act of merging two established districts and, I almost forgot, a global pandemic. Through Scouting, I've learned a great deal about myself and the importance of serving through leadership.
