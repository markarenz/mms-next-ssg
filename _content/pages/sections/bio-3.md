## Fun and Games

Remember Flash? I sure do. Before the advent of pocket computers, Flash was just about the most fun toy any overgrown kid could ask for. Branching out from multimedia work for clients, I began making games and managed to sell a few of them to sites like Miniclip. I put together a LAMP-stack site just to house them, and a few years later I had a library of around 30 games. Check out the Arcade Archive to play through some of the classics.

After expanding into Objective-C for iOS project, I worked with illustrators and writers to craft a series of kids' pop-up books and games for publishers like Random House and Highlights for Children.
