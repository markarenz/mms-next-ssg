## A Nerdy Journey

After working at my first job out of college for more than 20 years, I decided to move into data driven advertising and ran the digital half of an agency devoted to home services companies. Afterward, I worked at a creative agency in downtown Indianapolis with an amazing design team and overhauled their web development process to allow their designers to let their ideas run free. The result was a series of gorgeous sites based on visual motifs most folks didn't think was possible on the web.

I then dove headlong into web application work, first with PHP frameworks like Laravel and then into React. Shortly afterward, I started working with micro-frontends then jumped into NextJS and Typescript. It's been an amazing journey.
